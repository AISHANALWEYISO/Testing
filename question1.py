# question 1(a)
#create a program that calculates the area of a triangle 
base=int(input("Enter the base: "))
height=int(input("Enter the height: "))
area= (1/2) * base * height
 #print(f'The area = {area:.3f} units')
print(f"The area of the triangle with height{height } and base{base } is {area} units.")
